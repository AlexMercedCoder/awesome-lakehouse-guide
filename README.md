    <td>BtrBlocks introduces an efficient columnar storage format aimed at optimizing compression and decompression for data lakes, particularly when dealing with large datasets in cloud environments. The paper highlights how BtrBlocks outperforms traditional formats like Apache Parquet in both compression ratio and decompression speed. By using a combination of lightweight encoding schemes and a novel floating-point compression method called `Pseudodecimal Encoding`, BtrBlocks achieves significant improvements in scan performance, making it particularly useful for cloud-native systems that rely on high-throughput network environments like AWS S3. Key benefits include a 2.2x increase in scan speed and a 1.8x reduction in costs when compared to Parquet</td>
